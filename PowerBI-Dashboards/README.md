Challenges & Learnings
In creating this dashboard, I expanded my skills in data preparation, advanced DAX calculations, and report design. I also learned how to design custom background images in Power BI, which helped enhance the visual layout and storytelling of the dashboard. Ensuring proper alignment of visuals, filters, and seamless interaction between elements posed some challenges, but overcoming them reinforced my understanding of data transformation and visualization best practices.
